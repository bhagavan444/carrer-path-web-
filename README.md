# Career Path Recommendation System

## Overview
The Career Path Recommendation System is a machine learning–based application that provides personalized career recommendations to students and job seekers based on their skills, interests, and academic background. The system uses data-driven insights to help users make informed career decisions.

## Problem Statement
Many students struggle to choose the right career path due to a lack of personalized guidance. Traditional counseling methods are often generic and not data-driven. This project solves the problem by analyzing user inputs and recommending suitable career paths using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- Personalized career path recommendations
- Skill-based and interest-based analysis
- Machine learning–driven predictions
- Interactive and user-friendly interface
- Real-time recommendation results
- Scalable architecture for future improvements

## Tech Stack

### Programming Language
- Python

### Machine Learning & Data Processing
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Frontend / User Interface
- Streamlit

### Tools & Platforms
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

## System Architecture
1. User provides details such as skills, interests, and educational background.
2. Input data is cleaned and preprocessed.
3. The trained machine learning model analyzes the processed data.
4. Suitable career paths are predicted.
5. Results are displayed through an interactive Streamlit interface.

## Machine Learning Approach
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Real-time inference for user inputs
